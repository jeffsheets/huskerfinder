  <h2>About This Tool</h2>

  <p>Not sure what station to tune to when driving to that wedding? (who schedules a wedding on a gameday anyway!?) Not sure what town you're even close to?</p>

  <p>This app was built for you -- Find the radio stations that broadcast Husker football and volleyball games near your location</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>Uses your device's geolocation, then searches through a list of stations that carry Husker sports. Results sorted by distance from your location</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> We calculate distances based on city locations, not actual radio tower positions or signal coverage areas. Guessing that stations in closer cities will generally provide better reception, but this isn't always accurate.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Tips for Best Results</h3>
  <p>Since radio coverage can vary greatly based on terrain, weather, tower power, and other factors:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Try the first few stations in your list - don't stop at just the closest one</li>
    <li>AM stations often have better long-distance coverage, especially at night</li>
    <li>FM stations typically provide clearer audio when in range</li>
    <li>If you're having trouble with reception, try stations from nearby cities</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Alternative Options</h3>
  <p>If you can't find a clear radio signal, you can always stream the games live at <a href="https://huskers.com/listen" target="_blank">huskers.com/listen</a>. This is especially helpful when traveling outside of Nebraska or in areas with limited radio coverage.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>This tool was created by <a href="https://sheetsj.com" target="_blank">Jeff Sheets</a> -- I'm a Nebraska graduate and lifelong Husker fan. And I never seem to know what station to tune to, at home or on the road ü§£.</p>

  <h3>Technical Details</h3>
  <p>This application uses:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Browser geolocation API to determine your position</li>
    <li>A curated list of radio stations that carry Husker games</li>
    <li>Distance calculations to sort stations by proximity</li>
    <li>Interactive mapping to visualize station locations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://huskers.com" target="_blank">huskers.com</a> for serving as a reference for station information and providing the official streaming option.</p>
