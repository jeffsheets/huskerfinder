  <p>Not sure what station to tune to when driving to that wedding? (who schedules a wedding on a gameday anyway!?) Not sure what town you're even close to?</p>

  <p>This app was built for you -- Find the radio stations that broadcast Husker football and volleyball games near your location</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>Uses your device's geolocation, then searches through a list of stations that carry Husker sports. Results are sorted by distance from your location to the actual radio tower, with signal strength indicators to help you find the best reception.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Accuracy Note:</strong> We use actual FCC tower locations and calculate distances to those towers. Signal strength bars (▰▰▰▱) provide estimated signal quality based on tower power and distance, but actual reception depends on terrain, buildings, weather, and other factors. Try the closest stations first!</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Tips for Best Results</h3>
  <p>Since radio coverage can vary greatly based on terrain, weather, tower power, and other factors:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Try the first few stations in your list - don't stop at just the closest one</li>
    <li>Signal strength bars (▰▰▰▱) are estimates - always try the nearest towers first</li>
    <li>AM stations often have better long-distance coverage, especially at night</li>
    <li>FM stations typically provide clearer audio when in range</li>
    <li>If you're having trouble with reception, try multiple stations from the list</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Alternative Options</h3>
  <p>If you can't find a clear radio signal, you can always stream the games live at <a href="https://huskers.com/listen" target="_blank">huskers.com/listen</a>. This is especially helpful when traveling outside of Nebraska or in areas with limited radio coverage.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>This tool was created by <a href="https://sheetsj.com" target="_blank">Jeff Sheets</a> -- I'm a Nebraska graduate and lifelong Husker fan. And I never seem to know what station to tune to, at home or on the road 🤣.</p>

  <h3>Technical Details</h3>
  <p>This application uses:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Browser geolocation API to determine your position</li>
    <li>FCC (Federal Communications Commission) tower data for accurate location coordinates</li>
    <li>Transmitter power data to estimate signal strength</li>
    <li>Distance calculations using actual tower positions</li>
    <li>Interactive mapping powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap</li>
    <li>Signal strength estimates using RF propagation models (for reference only)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://huskers.com" target="_blank">huskers.com</a> for serving as a reference for station information and providing the official streaming option.</p>
