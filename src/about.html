  <h2>About This Tool</h2>

  <p>The Nebraska Husker Radio Finder helps you locate radio stations that broadcast Husker football and volleyball games near your location. Whether you're traveling across Nebraska or beyond, this tool makes it easy to stay connected to your favorite teams!</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>This tool uses your device's geolocation to find your current position, then searches through a database of radio stations that carry Husker sports programming. The stations are sorted by distance from your location, with the nearest ones appearing first.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This tool calculates distances based on city locations, not actual radio tower positions or signal coverage areas. It assumes that stations in closer cities will generally provide better reception, but this isn't always accurate.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Tips for Best Results</h3>
  <p>Since radio coverage can vary greatly based on terrain, weather, tower power, and other factors:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Try the first few stations in your list - don't stop at just the closest one</li>
    <li>AM stations often have better long-distance coverage, especially at night</li>
    <li>FM stations typically provide clearer audio when in range</li>
    <li>If you're having trouble with reception, try stations from nearby cities</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Alternative Options</h3>
  <p>If you can't find a clear radio signal, you can always stream the games live at <a href="https://huskers.com/listen" target="_blank">huskers.com/listen</a>. This is especially helpful when traveling outside of Nebraska or in areas with limited radio coverage.</p>

  <h3>About the Creator</h3>
  <p>This tool was created by <a href="https://sheetsj.com" target="_blank">Jeff Sheets</a>, a Nebraska graduate and lifelong Husker fan. As someone who has traveled across the Midwest following the team, Jeff understands the challenge of finding reliable radio coverage on the road.</p>

  <p>The goal is to make it easier for fellow Husker fans to stay connected to the games, whether they're driving to Lincoln for a home game or following the team on the road. Go Big Red! üåΩ</p>

  <h3>Technical Details</h3>
  <p>This application uses:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Browser geolocation API to determine your position</li>
    <li>A curated database of radio stations that carry Husker programming</li>
    <li>Distance calculations to sort stations by proximity</li>
    <li>Interactive mapping to visualize station locations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://huskers.com" target="_blank">huskers.com</a> for serving as a reference for station information and providing the official streaming option.</p>
